parameters:
  - name: collectionSpec
    description: |
       A CSV file with a Glob column with all the globs to collect.
       NOTE: Globs must not have a leading device.
    type: csv
    default: |
       Glob
       Users\*\AppData\Roaming\AnyDesk\*.trace
       Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk\*.trace
       Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk\Connection_trace.txt
       Users\*\AppData\Roaming\AnyDesk\chat\*.txt
       ProgramData\AnyDesk\*.trace
       Users\*\Videos\AnyDesk\*.anydesk
       Users\*\AppData\Roaming\AnyDesk\connection_trace.txt
       Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\AnyDesk\*
       
  - name: Root
    description: |
      On Windows, this is the device to apply all the glob on. On *NIX,
      this should be a path to a subdirectory but must not be a real
      device from /dev.
    default: "C:"
  - name: Accessor
    default: lazy_ntfs
    description: |
      On Windows, this can be left on `lazy_ntfs'. For *NIX, this value
      must be set to `file' since the ntfs accessors are not available.
  - name: Separator
    description: |
      The path separator used to construct the final globs from the root
      and the partial globs in `collectionSpec'.
    default: "\\"
